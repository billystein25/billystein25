## Hi there 👋
I'm Vasilis but you can call me Billy. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Patras; and more specifically at the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I have a passion for art and game development, and I'm always willing to learn something new.

## What are your tools?
Accross many projects I have primarily used C, C++, and Python. As a hobyist I spend a lot of my time learning Godot and researching Game Development as a whole. I have also made a couple of projects using HTML and PHP though I'm not as experienced with these languages compared to the previous ones.

## What are you working on now?
This semester I continue I'm running a Special Interest Group in my University under ACM where I teach about Game Development and Design. I am also doing research in Game Engine Architectures for my thesis that I will start developing next semester.

## What are you learning?
I recently started learning Rust and I'm currently working on a test project that I will share soon.

## Cool stuff I've built
- [ACM-Godot-Sig](https://github.com/billystein25/ACM-Godot-SIG) is the project we build in Godot to showcase different aspects of Game Development (currently ongoing).
- [GoMarginSprites](https://github.com/billystein25/GoMarginSprites) is a plugin for Godot that automatically scales sprites based on minimum and maximum margines in pixels for 2D and meters for 3D.
- [GlobalGameJam2026](https://github.com/billystein25/GlobalGameJam2026) is the game we built in the 2026 Global Game Jam as a team of 5 people.
